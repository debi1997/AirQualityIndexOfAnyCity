# AirQualityIndexOfAnyCity
As part of this task, develop a search engine that allows users to search for [Air Quality Index]

## Overview
We recommend using https://aqicn.org/api/ , but feel free to use any API provider of your choice. Be sure to document the API you choose as part of your submission.

Your product should allow users to -
- search for a city given the name and show info about the city
- display intersting attributes around the air quality included the api response

# Specifications

Your product should have 2 components

- Web service API ( serving restful APIs using nodejs / java / python )

- Front end layer rendering content ( html + css + javascript/typescript + toolsets like reactjs or similar )

## Web service

Develop a web service component that fetches the details from above API and serves them via an exposed API. Your service should cache vendor responses and give speedier result for repeating queries. You should handle typical scenarios that come with using a cache like cache expiry, max cache entries etc.

## UI layer
You may go with any design you wish to. Bonus points if the UI can display rich information. Use this as an opportunity to impress us with your creativity. You have freedom to choose your own UI libraries.


<strong><u>Points to note :</u></strong>
- Please follow REST API guidelines when designing your web service APIs
- The service should run locally ( ie the entire code should run locally via some framework, for example, a java project wrapped as a jar )
- If any guidelines here are not followed, that will be treated as an invalid submission


<strong><u>Aspects we will be looking at closely -</u></strong>
- Code quality, handling of conditions, edge cases
- Structuring of code for extensibility
- Good java/javascript coding practices
- Overall UI look and feel
- PERFORMANCE

<strong><u>Submission -</u></strong>
- Upload your code to a <strong>public</strong> github repository
- Reply to the email where you received the coding challenge <strong> without changing the subject</strong> to submit your submission
- <strong>Include a link to the github repo with your submission in the body</strong>


Happy Coding :)
